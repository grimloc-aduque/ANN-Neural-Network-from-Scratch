# ANN-Neural-Networks-from-Scratch

Several ML concepts involving neural networks were developed from scratch based on their mathematical derivation and mainly using numpy for programming.

# Linear Regression neural networks 
* Linear trends
* Nonlinear trends
    * Sinusoidal
    * Exponential
    * Polinomial
